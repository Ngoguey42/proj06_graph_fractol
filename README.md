# Project #6 fractol, Dec 2014
>>>>> #####Fractal exploration project.

#####Grade ``(TBD/100)`` ``(TBD/1..)*``
--------  -----------------------
Goals:
- [X] Use "minilibX", school's truncated version of "X11".
- [X] Read arguments to choose wich fractal to show.
- [X] Mandelbrot set. Zoom with mouse scroll.
- [X] Julia sets. Zoom with mouse scroll. Mouse position defines wich Julia to show.
- [X] One more fractal. Zoom with mouse scroll.

Recommended bonuses:
- [X] Movements.
- [X] Change colors on key press.
- [X] More fractals.
- [ ] 3d representation.
- [ ] Open two frames for two fractals, at the same time.

My additions:
* [X] Sierpinsky carpet, as a third fractal.
- [X] "+/-" keys to change the number of loops.
- [X] Time dependant movements, instead of CPU dependant. ([events.c](https://github.com/Ngoguey42/proj06_graph_fractol/blob/master/events.c)) ([libft/srcs/ft_clock[...].c](https://github.com/Ngoguey42/proj06_graph_fractol/tree/master/libft/srcs))
- [X] Multi thread rendering. ([draw_screen_async.c](/draw_screen_async.c))
- [X] SDL compatibility. (dirty)

Usage:
```sh
make
./fractol JMS
```
